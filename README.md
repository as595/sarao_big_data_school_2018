## Shortcuts for projects in IDIA Cloud

## First step
 After receiving your username and password for the IDIA cloud VM you are welcome to change you password by 
 ssh'ing to jedi's VM using the code/line below.
 ```
 ssh -XY username@skabigdata.idia.ac.za
 ```
 Upon successful login you may change your password to the one that you are more comfortable with. This you can do by typing
 ```
 passwd
 ```
You may follow the instructions that follow in changing your password

You can also login to the JupyterLab using https://skabigdata.idia.ac.za and use your username and password(Unfortunately you cannot change your password).

## Groups
All users  belong to a certain group and the 2 main groups are students or tutors groups:
- students : you are a student and belong to students group
- tutors : you are a tutor and you belong to the tutors group

## Storage
Our VM's access to data is managed by Unix groups.

* `/data/users` This is the home directory
* `/data/containers`  This contains all containers that are available 
* `/data/tutors`  This is an extra folder that tutors can use to collaborate if needed
* `/data/projects` This is where all project data is, it is also devided into project folders. You only have the write access to the project folder you belong to.
